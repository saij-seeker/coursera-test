            Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as 
            cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the 
            world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
            Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, 
            grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, 
            depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, 
            prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes 
            cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations
            of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2] </p>
